# Expose OSGi Services via GraphQL 

**Please note**: example contained in this bundle is incomplete and is now deprecated. Please use automated test contained in `org.gecko.whiteboard.graphql.emf.example.test` bundle, which covers all methods from implementation contained in `org.gecko.whiteboard.graphql.emf.example.service` bundle.

---

This example is built exactly as the one in `org.gecko.whiteboard.graphql.example`, with the only difference that here we are using EObject instead of simple Java Pojos. The steps to be followed are the same, thus for the documentation, please refer to [this](../org.gecko.whiteboard.graphql.example/README.md)
